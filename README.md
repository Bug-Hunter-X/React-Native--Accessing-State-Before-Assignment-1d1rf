This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in React Native applications: accessing state or props before they have been assigned values.  The `Bug.js` file showcases the incorrect implementation, leading to undefined or unexpected behavior.  The solution, provided in `BugSolution.js`, illustrates how to correctly handle this situation using conditional rendering or asynchronous operations.
